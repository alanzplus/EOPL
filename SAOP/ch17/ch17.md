# Chapter 17 Using Continuations

## Exercise 
### 17.1
**Description**

> Rewrite cycle-proc using continutaions instead of recursion as presented in Program 14.11.

> Program 14.11

```racket
(define cycle-proc
  (lambda (th)
    (letrec ([loop (lambda ()
                     (th)
                     (loop))])
      (loop))))
```

**Solution**

```racket
(define cycle-proc
  (lambda (th)
    (let ([cc (call/cc (lambda (cont) cont))])
      (th)
      (cc cc))))
```
